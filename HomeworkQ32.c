// Q)Search about what is 'memory leak' in C

// ANS)The memory leak occurs, when a piece of memory which was previously allocated by the programmer.
// Then it is not deallocated properly by programmer. That memory is no longer in
// use by the program. So that place is reserved for no reason. Thatâ€™s why this
// is called the memory leak.

// For the memory leak, some block of memory may have wasted. If the system has enough memory, in
// that case also this may slow down the performance.
